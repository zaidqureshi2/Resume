<h2>About</h2>

<p>Make voice AI accessible for underserved langauges around the world. Previously, spent 10+ years building large-scale systems, I launched Guardrails for Amazon Bedrock, a pioneering service for safeguarding LLMs. I have created optimization initiatives projected to save $100M+ annually, also led projects that have saved $200M annually. Like solving ambiguous business problems with technology, bridging the gap between technical complexity and business needs, and driving measurable impact.</p>
